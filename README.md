# Unit 10 OOP Homework: Template Engine - Employee Summary

One of the most important aspects of programming is writing code that is readable, reliable, and maintainable. Oftentimes, *how* we design our code is just as important as the code itself. In this homework assignment, my challenge was to build a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Since testing is a key piece in making code maintainable, I ensured that all unit tests pass. The application prompts the user to build an engineering team. An engineering
team consists of a manager, and any number of engineers and interns.

```

so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles
